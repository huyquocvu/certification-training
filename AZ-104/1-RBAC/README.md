```PowerShell
Get-AZRoleAssignment

# Lists Azure RBAC role assignments at the specified scope. 
# By default it lists all role assignments in the selected Azure subscription. 
```

```PowerShell
New-AZRoleAssignment -SignInName $userSignin `
    -RoleDefinitionName $roleDefinitionName `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName

# Adds role assignment to specified user
```
```PowerShell
Get-AZRoleDefinition

# Lists all Azure RBAC roles that are available for assignment.
```
```PowerShell
New-AZRoleDefinition

# Creates a custom role in Azure RBAC. 
# Provide either a JSON role definition file or a PSRoleDefinition object as input. 
# First, use the Get-AzRoleDefinition command to generate a baseline role definition object. 
# Then, modify its properties as required. 
# Finally, use this command to create a custom role using role definition.
```

$role.Actions.Clear()
$role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.Storage/*/read")need
$role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.Network/*/read")
$role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.Compute/*/read")

# Clear and add own assignable scope
$role.AssignableScopes.Clear()
$role.AssignableScopes.Add("/subscriptions/0000-1111-2222-aaaa-123456778")

# Add the custom role
New-AZRoleDefinition -Role $role
```
